## Fovus - AWS Coding Challenge (Vaibhav Rajani)

#### âœ¨ This project is designed to demonstrate a full-stack application using React for the frontend and AWS CDK for the backend. The application allows users to upload files and input text through a web interface, which then interacts with AWS services such as DynamoDB and S3 to store and manage data.

## Install

Start by cloning this repository.

> Configure backend

```sh
cd backend
npm i
cdk deploy
```

> Configure frontend

```sh
cd ..
npm install
npm run start
```

This will serve the application on http://localhost:3000.

ðŸ‘¤ **AWS CLI configured with Administrator access**

Put this in your .env folder

```sh
REACT_APP_API_URL="https://22vd8pheqj.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod"
```
